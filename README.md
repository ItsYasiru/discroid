# Discroid

An async API wrapper for discords' API, currently in development. Inspiration and structuring ideas taken from [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and [Discum](https://github.com/Merubokkusu/Discord-S.C.U.M).

## TODO

- Cleaner implmentation for application commands
- Finish off all the data casts
- Cache the websocket payloads puched on events
- Cover all the API endpoints
